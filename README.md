In this code I use many image processing and image segmentation techniques to detect cracks in pavements images using Matlab. Also the code uses an estimation of the area in image to estimate the dimensions of the cracks in meters.

With the code you will get a detailed report with clear explanation of algorithm used to detect the crack also the code is commented at each line.
